It was a beautiful day in the software development world, and the developers at the prestigious coding company, Codeville, were gearing up for yet another heated debate. The topic of the day? The ever-controversial Design vs. Functionality.

On one side of the room stood the Design Advocates, wearing their stylish turtlenecks and carrying MacBook Pros. On the other side stood the Functionality Fans, sporting their hoodies and proudly displaying their ThinkPads.

"Design is the key to success!" proclaimed the lead Designer, Jane. "A beautiful user interface is the first impression a user has of our product. It must be top-notch, or else no one will want to use it."

"Pssh, design is overrated," countered the lead Developer, Jack. "Functionality is what truly matters. People don't care how pretty a product is if it doesn't actually work."

Just then, a Junior Developer named Alex entered the room and raised their hand. "Excuse me, but I have a solution that combines both design and functionality. It's called responsive design."

The room fell silent as Alex pulled out a piece of code.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .navbar {
        display: none;
    }
    .navbar-toggle {
        display: block;
    }
}
```

"You see, this code adjusts the display of the navigation bar based on the width of the screen. It's both functional and visually appealing."

The Design Advocates and Functionality Fans stared in awe at the clever solution.

"Well, it looks like we have a winner," said Jane, extending a hand to Jack.

"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree," chuckled Jack, shaking Jane's hand.

And with that, the great Design vs. Functionality debate was put to rest, at least for the time being.
