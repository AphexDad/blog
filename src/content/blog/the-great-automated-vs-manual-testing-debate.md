Once upon a time, at a software development company, there were two developers named Chuck and Dave. Chuck was a firm believer in the power of automated testing, while Dave was a die-hard fan of manual testing.

One day, while working on a project, the two found themselves in a heated debate about which method of testing was the best.

"Manual testing is just too slow and unreliable," Chuck exclaimed. "Automated testing is faster and more consistent. Plus, it can be run at any time and doesn't require human intervention."

But Dave wasn't having it. "With manual testing, you can catch bugs that automated tests just can't. Plus, it helps to have a human touch in the testing process."

The argument continued back and forth, until their manager intervened and suggested they settle the argument with a coding competition. They would each write a test for a small code snippet and see which method found the most bugs.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
```

After a heated race against the clock, both tests were run. To everyone's surprise, Chuck's automated test found a bug in the subtract function that Dave's manual test missed. Chuck let out a triumphant cheer, while Dave hung his head in defeat.

From that day on, Chuck and Dave worked together in harmony, using both automated and manual testing to ensure their code was bug-free. The end.
