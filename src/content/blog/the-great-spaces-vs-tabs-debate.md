The software development community was in an uproar. Developers were divided into two factions: those who preferred using spaces for indentation and those who swore by tabs.

One day, at a local code sprint, the argument reached its boiling point. The spaces camp, led by a developer named Sarah, argued that spaces were more visually appealing and made the code easier to read. Meanwhile, the tabs camp, led by a developer named Tom, insisted that tabs were more efficient and saved precious keyboard real estate.

The argument went back and forth for hours, with neither side giving an inch. That was until someone suggested that they settle the matter with a coding challenge. Each side would have to write a program that calculated the value of pi to the nth decimal, and the first one to finish would be declared the winner.

Sarah, being a confident coder, confidently typed away using only spaces for indentation. Tom, equally confident, banged away at his keyboard using only tabs. In the end, they both finished at the same time and produced the following code:

```js
function calcPi(n) {
  let pi = 0;
  let divisor = 1;
  let sign = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    pi += sign * (4 / divisor);
    sign *= -1;
    divisor += 2;
  }
  return pi;
}
```

They both looked at each other in surprise, as they had produced identical code. The judges declared the match a draw, and the two sides grudgingly called a truce. From that day forward, they all agreed to use whichever indention method made them most comfortable, as long as the code was readable and efficient. And so, the great debate between spaces and tabs was finally laid to rest.
